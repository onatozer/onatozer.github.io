      abstract={LLMs have shown the capacity to improve their performance on reasoning tasks through reflecting on their mistakes, and acting with these reflections in mind. However, continual reflections of the same LLM onto itself exhibit degeneration of thought, where the LLM continues to repeat the same errors again and again even with the knowledge that its wrong. To address this problem, we instead use multi-agent multi-persona debate between LLMs to generate the reflections.}

      abstract={As part of a larger effort to use machine learning to predict the need for resurgery following reduction of distal radius fracture [1], multiple pre- and post-reduction measures of the relative position and orientation of the radius, ulna, and wrist bones (carpals) have been found to be of high predictive value. The most important of these measures include radial height, ulnar variance, and radial inclination. Typically, such anatomical quantities are obtained through manual computer-based measurement performed by experienced radiolgists or orthpaedic surgeons. This requires extensive time and can involve a degree of human error, as inter-rater reliability is not 100%. Therefore, it would be desirable, and more robust, to have a fully-automated means to obtain such measures from collected radiographs. As a first step toward this goal, this project demonstrates how state-of-the-art segmentation models can be used to automatically generate accurate measurements for many of the desired critical criteria.}

      code={https://github.com/onatozer/CMPLXSYS_530_final_paper},
      abstract={Neural networks have shown themselves to be one of the most powerful tools in machine learning, becoming an essential building block as a part in any machine learning application. However, a clear issue with neural networks is the ‘black box’ dilemma, often, predictions made by the neural network don’t appear to have a clear rationale behind them, and often involve learning some alien correlations between data points that may or may not truly reflect the underlying truth. The goal of this project is to help alleviate this problem by using network analysis to illuminate the trends in what the neural network is learning during training}
